Based on previous research "On-the-fly Page Migration and Address Reconciliation for Heterogeneous Memory Systems" from the same author.

#### Key Insights
Adaptive migration polices: Previous page migration techniques relied on fixed hotness thresholds: a page is migrated from slow memories to faster memories when the number of times that page was accessed exceeds the hotness threshold. In contrast, we control page migration policies based on applicationsâ€™ memory access behaviors. Our technique increases or reduces the hotness thresholds to reduce or increase the number of pages migrated based on either the number of pages migrated over a window of observation or based on the observed benefits of page migrations (were pages accessed after the migration to faster memories).

AR overheads can defeat the benefits of page migration: To eliminate AR, we explore the benefit of reverse migrating pages to their original locations, particularly when the migrated pages are no longer heavily accessed. Reverse migration makes page migration invisible to the OS. However, reverse migrations can result in excessive data movement between slow and fast memories. In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of the reverse migration technique.

#### Algorithm
If the count is high (too many pages have been migrated), we double the hotness threshold to reduce future migrations; likewise, if too few pages have been migrated in a twindow, we halve the hotness threshold to increase future Adaptive Migration Based on Number of Pages Migrated migrations. In our experiments, we used 4 million cycles as our twindow.6 We also limit the hotness threshold variations between 64 and 256.

We define the MBQ as the average number of accesses to pages that were recently migrated to HBM. If the MBQ is less than a threshold (min_MBQ), then migrations are halted; migrations are resumed if the MBQ is greater than another threshold (max_MBQ).

##### Summary
Two Algorithm
1. Based on number of page migrated, if too many page is migrared, reduce migration by increase threshold.
2. Based on reference after migration, if too less after migration, reduce or stop.
