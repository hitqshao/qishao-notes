- Hybrid Memory
- Blk/Page Size 2KB/64KB
  64KB page size is due to the fact that it maps all memory in dram and hbm.
  Every request will cam PRT and BLE. 
  In multi core simulation env,it have to support multi core read and write the SRAM.
- Distinguish Spacial Locality and Temporal Locality.
  cacheHBM (cHBM) for temporal locality
  memoryHBM (mHBM) for spacial locality
- Page Allocation.
  Different from previous design that allocate all memory in HBM or DRAM. It allocate page according to its neighbour pages.
  But it does not mention how it interact with page table. If page is deallocate or written back to disk, the PRT should also be updated.
- The ratio between cHBM and mHBM is flexible.

- If memory footprint is high, all used by OS, all the HBM will be served as flat memory.

Cited from org paper:
In each remapping set, the hotness tracker includes a hot table and five parameters: the HBM occupied ratio (Rh), a hotness threshold (T) to decide if an off-chip DRAM page should be brought in HBM for high Rh condition, the number of cHBM pages (Nc), and the number of mHBM pages in which most blocks have/have not been accessed (Na/Nn).

For SL>0 (strong spatial locality), more hot data should be brought in mHBM to better exploit the spatial locality and utilize the memory bandwidth. For SL ≤ 0 (weak spatial locality), hot data should be cached in cHBM to reduce over-fetching.

The threshold T in the hotness tracker can alleviate this issue. If Rh is high, for SL>0, only pages whose hotness value is larger than T are permitted to be migrated to mHBM and for SL ≤ 0, only blocks in a page whose hotness value is larger than T are permitted to be cached in
cHBM.
#### Me
From this aspect, SL means that number of mHBM pages that most blocks have been accessed is far larger than not been accessed. This means strong spatial locality.
