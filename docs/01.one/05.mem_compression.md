#### 1. Compresso: Pragmatic Main Memory Compression

Cite from the paper:
We propose Compresso, with optimizations to reduce compressed data movement in a hardware compressed memory, while maintaining high compression ratio by repacking data at the right time.

Compresso uses the modified BPC compression algorithm, achieving 1.85x average compression on a wide range of applications.

Compresso uses the compression granularity of 64B.

Compresso uses LinePack with 4 possible cache line sizes.

We compare variable-sized chunks (512B, 1KB, 2KB and 4KB) with 512B fixed-sized chunks. Compresso uses incremental allocation in 512B chunks,thereby allowing 8 page sizes (512B, 1KB, 1.5KB and so on).

Additional Data Movement:
1. split-access cachelines
2. changes in compressibility(overflows)
3. metadata access

Difference in exception in LCP compression
Instead, Compresso allows some number of such inflated cachelines to be stored uncompressed in the inflation room at the end of an MPA page, provided that there is space in that page (Fig. 5a). This is similar to the
exception region in LCP, but is used for an entirely different reasonâ€”to reduce compression-related data movement, rather than to support a specific packing scheme.

We present the first main-memory compression architecture that is designed to run an unmodified operating system.
