Based on previous research "On-the-fly Page Migration and Address Reconciliation for Heterogeneous Memory Systems" from the same author.

Adaptive migration polices: Previous page migration techniques relied on fixed hotness thresholds: a page is migrated from slow memories to faster memories when the number of times that page was accessed exceeds the hotness threshold. In contrast, we control
page migration policies based on applicationsâ€™ memory access behaviors. Our technique increases or reduces the hotness thresholds to reduce or increase the number of pages
migrated based on either the number of pages migrated over a window of observation or based on the observed benefits of page migrations (were pages accessed after the migration
to faster memories).

AR overheads can defeat the benefits of page migration: To eliminate AR, we explore the benefit of reverse migrating pages to their original locations, particularly when the migrated
pages are no longer heavily accessed. Reverse migration makes page migration invisible to the OS. However, reverse migrations can result in excessive data movement between slow
and fast memories. In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of the reverse migration technique.
