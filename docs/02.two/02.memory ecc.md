1. 4-bit data path requires 3 bits for ECC (8 entry table) (75% increase in size)
2. 8-bit data path requires 5 bits for ECC or 1 bit for parity.
3. 11-bit data path requires 4 bits for ECC (16 entry table)
4. 16-bit data path requires 6 bit for ECC or 2 bits for parity
5. 32-bit data path requires 7 bits for ECC or 4 bits for parity (21.8% increase in size)
6. 64-bit (8 byte) data path requires 8 bits for ECC and parity (12.5% increase in size)
7. 128-bit (16 bytes) data path requires 9 bits for ECC or 16 bits for parity (7% increase in size
