### 1. Revisiting Wide Superscalar Microarchitecture
**Must Read**

Impact :thumbsup: :thumbsup:  :thumbsup:  :thumbsup: 

Understand :relaxed: :relaxed:

This paper discussed the chanllening issue of wide superscalar microarchitecture might trigger.

Also from **circuit perspective**.

**Contributions**
* This study shows that considering wide issue instead of narrow issue clusters has a dramatic impact on the performance of Mod-N, one of the simplest steering  policy.
* We find that, with wide issue clusters, if the instruction window is large enough and considering a realistic intercluster delay, the optimal value of N is much larger than three, typically several tens.
* We argue that the instruction window and the issue width can be augmented by combining clustering and register write specialization.
* we propose two independent and orthogonal energy optimizations exploiting loops.
  - The first optimization we propose is a mechanism to detect redundant microops producing the same result on every iteration and to remove these micro-ops from the execution core.
  - The second optimization focuses on saving energy consumed by load microops.
* We also test this mechanism with a configuration which emulates what happens for very large instruction footprint applications.

Chapter 2 **state of the art** is so well-written.

### 2. Banked Multiported Register Files for High-Frequency Superscalar Microprocessors
Impact :thumbsup: :thumbsup:  :thumbsup: 

Understand :relaxed:

**Contribution**
* banked register file with much simpler and faster control logic while only slightly increasing the number of ports per bank
* We present area, delay, and energy numbers extracted from layouts of the banked register file

**Conclusion**

Area

* As the number of local ports per bank is reduced, area drops dramatically
* Compared to the baseline design, the designs with four banks are around one quarter the size, and the designs with eight banks are around one third the size.
* Apart from the reduction in storage cell size, designs with smaller numbers of ports per bank have significantly less address decoder area than the highly multiported designs. Each bank has fewer decoders with narrower addresses.
* Designs with two read ports per bank are not much larger than designs with a single read port per bank given that the single read port must connect to all global read ports whereas each of the two read ports only connects to half of the global read
ports.
* For the fully ported storage cell designs, using hierarchical bitlines cuts delay by 8–17%.
* The lesser-ported bank designs have a slightly greater reduction in delay, at around 25% faster for the two read, two write port case.


* we found the (8/2/2/y/y) configuration to perform well for this design point, and we chose this as our center point in perturbing other parameters.
* Reducing the number of banks to four (4/2/2/y/y), lowers performance by another 3–4%.
* We can also see that moving from 1 to 2 write ports (8/2/1/y/y, 8/2/2/y/y) improves performance by more than 4% but having more than 2 write ports per bank (8/2/4/y/y and 8/2/8/y/y) adds only another 0.3%.
* This is expected given that average IPCs are rarely above 2, and some instructions do not write registers.


**Remarks**

This paper discussed in detail the circuit design and tradeoff of multi-bank register file and bypass network.

The area break down of multi bank and multi port.
