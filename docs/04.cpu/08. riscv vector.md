### [24] RISCV2 A Scalable RISC-V Vector Processor

Coupled with dynamically allocated register, at run time, the new register remapping mechanism enables:
- dynamic hardware-based loop unrolling
- optimized instruction scheduling

Decoupled execution scheme employs resource acquire-and-release semantics to disambiguate between parallel computation and memory-access instruction streams

Vector instruction operate on mutiple elements, the vIS stages transfroms vector instructions into multuple micro-operations(uops), each uop operating on a different register groups.

Each logic register is mapped to a group of reigster, instread of one-on-one  mapping.

The new reigster remapping mechanism facilitates dynamic loop unrolling in hardware.

The unrolling mitigates the stall incurred by data dependencies, since direct consumer of a result is now seperated from its producer by multiple uops.

Consequently, resource utilization increase substantially.
