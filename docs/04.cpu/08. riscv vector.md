### [24] RISCV2 A Scalable RISC-V Vector Processor

Coupled with dynamically allocated register, at run time, the new register remapping mechanism enables:
- dynamic hardware-based loop unrolling
- optimized instruction scheduling

Decoupled execution scheme employs resource acquire-and-release semantics to disambiguate between parallel computation and memory-access instruction streams

#### Register Remapping and dynamic register file allocation

Vector instruction operate on mutiple elements, the vIS stages transfroms vector instructions into multuple micro-operations(uops), each uop operating on a different register groups.

Each logic register is mapped to a group of reigster, instread of one-on-one  mapping.

The new reigster remapping mechanism facilitates dynamic loop unrolling in hardware.

The unrolling mitigates the stall incurred by data dependencies, since direct consumer of a result is now seperated from its producer by multiple uops.

Consequently, resource utilization increase substantially.

#### Decoupled execution: computation and memory access

As to memory instructions that does not access execution lanes, they are routed after vRRM pipeline stage directly to the memory unit.

The memory unit features two parallel engines that allows the simultaneous processing and disambiguaing of one load and one store instructions.

Traditionally, synchronization is decoupled processor schemes is achieved by employing so called synchronization queues and specical move operation.

These are not amenable to vector processors. **Here I dont understand.**

They keep a ghost copy of instructin dispatched to vIS stage which updates scoreboard, maintain the wakeup function.
