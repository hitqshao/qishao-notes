### 1. Attach´e: Towards Ideal Memory Compression by Mitigating Metadata Bandwidth Overheads [MICRO]
Year: 2018

**Attach´e does not use the free space made available by compression.**

**Compression Predictor (COPR), predicts if the memory block is compressed.**

**Global Indication(GI)**: GI is composed of eight two-bit saturating counters, each of which keeps track of the compressibility of 18th the memory space. 
GI can be used as an accurate indicator for predicting the compressibility within a memory space if there is abundant similarity in compressibility.

**Page-Level Predictor (PaPR)**: By exploiting the similarity in the compressibility of cachelines within an OS page [12], [18], [37], PaPR provides compression predictions at the page granularity.

**Line-Level Predictor (LiPR)**:  LiPR is a set-associative cache structure indexed by the page number. LiPR uses the two-bit values of PaPR to determine if the neighboring cachelines have the same compressibility.

### 2. Enabling Transparent Memory-Compression for Commodity Memory Systems [HPCA]
Year: 2019

**Transparent Memory-Compression (TMC) can provide bandwidth benefits of memory compression in an OS-transparent manner by trying to exploit only the increased bandwidth and not the extra capacity.**

**Line Location Predictor (LLP)** that can determine the location of the line with 98% accuracy and a dynamic solution that disables compression if the benefits of compression are smaller than the overheads.

We propose a history-based Line Location Predictor (LLP), that can identify the correct location of the line with a high accuracy (98%). The LLP is based on the observation that lines within a page tend to have similar compressibility.

LLP contains the Last Compressibility Table (LCT), that tracks the last compression status seen for a given index. The LCT is indexed with the hash of the page address. 
So, for a given access, the index corresponding to the page address is used to predict the compressibility, then line location.

Even though the LLP is quite small, it provides an accuracy of 98%, much higher than the hit-rate of the metadata cache.

LCP stores metadata inline with block.
