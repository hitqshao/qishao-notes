**Attach´e does not use the free space made available by compression.**

**Compression Predictor (COPR), predicts if the memory block is compressed.**

**Global Indication(GI)**: GI is composed of eight two-bit saturating counters, each of which keeps track of the compressibility of 18th the memory space. 
GI can be used as an accurate indicator for predicting the compressibility within a memory space if there is abundant similarity in compressibility.

**Page-Level Predictor (PaPR)**: By exploiting the similarity in the compressibility of cachelines within an OS page [12], [18], [37], PaPR provides compression predictions at the page granularity.

**Line-Level Predictor (LiPR)**:  LiPR is a set-associative cache structure indexed by the page number. LiPR uses the two-bit values of PaPR to determine if the neighboring cachelines have the same compressibility.
