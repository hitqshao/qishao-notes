### 1. [215] CudaDMA: Optimizing GPU Memory Bandwidth via Warp Specialization

API:
-  One synchronization point corresponds to the data having been consumed and the buffer standing empty awaiting the next transfer.\
   The compute threads indicate this status using a non-blocking call to *start_async_dma()*
-  The DMA threads wait to begin this transfer using the blocking call *wait_for_dma_start()*
-  DMA warps indicate that a transfer is complete using a non-blocking call to *finish_async_dma()*
-  The compute warps wait for a transfer to complete using a blocking call to *wait_for_dma_finish()*
-  The DMA-side calls are usually abstracted behind execute_dma()
