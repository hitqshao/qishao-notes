# 1.[2023] Evaluating Unified Memory Performance in HIP

UM only works on recent AMD GPUs, including Vega10 and MI100.\
There are two flavors of the support: XNACK-enabled and XNACK-disabled.\
- In the XNACK-enabled mode,a GPU can handle retry of a memory access after page-faults, which enables mapping and migrating data on demand, as well 
as memory overcommitment.
- In the XNACK-disabled mode, all memory must be resident and mapped in GPU page tables when the GPU is executing application code.\
The XNACK-enabled mode only has experimental support.

The experimental results show that the performance of the applications using UM is closely related to data transfer size and memory accesses of a kernel. Compared to “UM”, prefetching 
memory as a memory usage hint leads to significant data transfers between the host and device.

Compared to “UM”, prefetching memory as a memory usage hint leads to significant data transfers between the host and device.

- “UM-hint” and “UM” indicate unified memory with and without memory usage hints, respectively.
- “ZeroCopy” uses zero-copy buffers for data migration.
- “PageableCopy” copies data from pageable host memory to device memory
-  “PageLockedCopy” transfers data from page-locked host memory to device memory

## Result Analysis
The result shows that the stall rate is highly sensitive to the increase of memory size in UM.

The decrease of the kernel execution time ranges from approximately 1.1X to 2.8X with respect to the vector length for the three optimization techniques.、
However, the execution time is still approximately 1.4X to 74.8X **longer than that of the kernel that takes the copy-then-execute** approach.

In [28], the authors present 32 open-source UM benchmarks in CUDA and evaluate their performance on an NVIDIA Pascal GPU.\
They find that across the benchmarks the performance of the UM benchmarks is on average **34.2%** slower compared with the benchmarks without UM due to the cost of page fault 
handling
