## 1.[2023] Evaluating Unified Memory Performance in HIP

UM only works on recent AMD GPUs, including Vega10 and MI100.\
There are two flavors of the support: XNACK-enabled and XNACK-disabled.\
- In the XNACK-enabled mode,a GPU can handle retry of a memory access after page-faults, which enables mapping and migrating data on demand, as well 
as memory overcommitment.
- In the XNACK-disabled mode, all memory must be resident and mapped in GPU page tables when the GPU is executing application code.\
The XNACK-enabled mode only has experimental support.

The experimental results show that the performance of the applications using UM is closely related to data transfer size and memory accesses of a kernel. Compared to “UM”, prefetching 
memory as a memory usage hint leads to significant data transfers between the host and device.

Compared to “UM”, prefetching memory as a memory usage hint leads to significant data transfers between the host and device.

- “UM-hint” and “UM” indicate unified memory with and without memory usage hints, respectively.
- “ZeroCopy” uses zero-copy buffers for data migration.
- “PageableCopy” copies data from pageable host memory to device memory
-  “PageLockedCopy” transfers data from page-locked host memory to device memory

### Result Analysis
The result shows that the stall rate is highly sensitive to the increase of memory size in UM.

The decrease of the kernel execution time ranges from approximately 1.1X to 2.8X with respect to the vector length for the three optimization techniques.、
However, the execution time is still approximately 1.4X to 74.8X **longer than that of the kernel that takes the copy-then-execute** approach.

In [28], the authors present 32 open-source UM benchmarks in CUDA and evaluate their performance on an NVIDIA Pascal GPU.\
They find that across the benchmarks the performance of the UM benchmarks is on average **34.2%** slower compared with the benchmarks without UM due to the cost of page fault 
handling

### Main Idea in Short
- Mainly focus on how many pages that covers the page-fault pages should be migrated.
- Prefetching with upgraded range, which balance the prefetching and also reduce the number of TLB shootdowns
- TLB shootdown is estimated at 100 cycles
- **Memory Oversubscription and Eviction is not considered.**
- Page Migration Threshold accustomed to each workload is complex. And not worth it. It is better to just migrate on first touch.

### Introduction

### Contribution
- Counter-based metrics to determine when to migrate pages from the CPU to GPU are insufficient for finding an optimal migration policy to exploit GPU memory bandwidth.\
In streaming workloads, where each page may be accessed only a few times, waiting for N accesses to occur before migrating a page will actually limit the number of accesses that occur after migration, reducing the efficacy of the page migration operation.
2) TLB shootdown and refill overhead can significantly degrade the performance of any page migration policy for GPUs.\
We show that combining reactive migration with virtual address locality information to aggressively prefetch pages can mitigate much of this overhead, resulting in increased GPU throughput.

### Interesting Experiment

Performance comparson of DDR and GDDR Experiments

This choice is motivated by our observation that the performance of some GPU compute workloads would degrade by as much as 66% if the traditional GDDR memory on a GPU were replaced with standard DDR memory, as seen in Figure 2.

### Interesting Finding
#### Clustered Page
Page Accessing is clusted by memory arranges.\
Part of continuous virtual address is hot.\
This clustering is key to range expansion because it suggests that if a page is identified for migration, then other neighboring pages in the virtual address space are likely to have a similar number of total touches.
#### Threshold to trigger page migration

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dced8b99-52e5-4390-9b4c-f825afe21cf2)


a first touch policy (threshold-1) requires no tracking information and can be trivially implemented by migrating a page the first time the GPU
translates an address for the page.

Considering the performance differential seen across thresholds, we believe the overhead of implementing the necessary hardware counters to track all pages within a system to differentiate their access counts is not worth the improvement over a vastly simpler first-touch migration policy.

### TLB

The runtime system also must be cognizant that performing TLB invalidations (an integral part of page migration) on a GPU does not just halt a single processor, but thousands of compute pipelines that may be accessing these pages through a large shared TLB structure.\
This shared TLB structure makes page migrations between a CPU and GPU potentially much more costly (in terms of the opportunity cost of lost execution throughput) than in CPU-only systems.



Recent papers have provided proposals about how to efficiently implement general purpose TLBs that are, or could be, optimized for a GPU’s needs [28]–[30].\
Others have recently looked at improving TLB reach by exploiting locality within the virtual to physical memory remapping, or avoiding this layer completely [31]–[33].\
Finally, Gerofi et al. [34] recently examined TLB performance of the Xeon Phi for applications with large footprints, while McCurdy et al. [35]
investigated the effect of superpages and TLB coverage for HPC applications in the context of CPUs.

### 15. [ASPLOS] DeepUM: Tensor Migration and Prefetching in Unified Memory
The key feature of Capuchin is that it makes memory management decisions based on dynamic tensor access pattern tracked at runtime. \
This design is motivated by the observation that the access pattern to tensors is regular during training iterations. \
Based on the identified patterns, one can exploit the total memory optimization space and offer the fine-grain and flexible control of when and how to perform
memory optimization techniques.

#### Introduction

BERT 768 hiddenlayers 73GB memory int training.\
V100 32GB on-board memory and P100 16GB on-board memory.


Feature maps are produced in the forward propagation and used again in the backward propagation.\
Major deep learning frameworks such as Tensorflow , MXNet and Pytorch usually maintain these feature maps in GPU memory until they are no longer
needed in backward propagation computation. \
However, there is usually a large gap between two accesses to the same feature map in forward and backward propagation, which incurs high memory consumption to store the intermediate results.

To reduce memory consumption:
- swapping
- recomputting

Key observaions:

- we believe that dynamically tracking fine-grained tensor accesses is a fundamental and general technique that enables effective memory management optimizations.\
  This paper demonstrates that this essential idea can be implemented efficiently on top of major deep learning frameworks.
- The training process is composed of millions of iterations with clear boundaries, and the tensor accesses have regular and repeated access patterns across iterations.\
  This means that analyzing the timing and tensor access patterns can easily reveal the memory optimization opportunities with concrete guidance
