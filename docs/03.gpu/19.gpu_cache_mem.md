****Global Memory Latency****

- very large s1 = 32 MB to construct the TLB/page table miss and cache miss (P5&P6)
- set s2 = 1 MB to construct the L1 TLB hit but cache miss (P4)
- After a total of 65 data accesses, 65 data lines are loaded into the cache.\
  We then visit the cached data lines with s1 again for several times, to construct cache hit but TLB miss (P2&P3).
- set s3 = 1 element and repeatedly load the data in a cache line so that every memory access is a cache hit (P1).

- The Maxwell and Kepler devices have a unique memory access pattern (P6) for page table context switching. \
  When a kernel is launched, only memory page entries of 512 MB are activated. \
  If the thread visits an inactivate page entry, the hardware needs a rather long time to switch between page tables.\
  This phenomena is also reported in [22] as page table “miss”.
- The Maxwell L1 data cache addressing does not go through the TLBs or page tables.\
  On the GTX980, there is no TLB miss pattern (i.e., P2 and P3) when the L1 data cache is hit.\
  Once the L1 cache is missed, the access latency increases from tens of cycles to hundreds or even thousands of cycles.
-  The TLBs are off-chip.
