****Global Memory Latency****

- very large s1 = 32 MB to construct the TLB/page table miss and cache miss (P5&P6)
- set s2 = 1 MB to construct the L1 TLB hit but cache miss (P4)
- After a total of 65 data accesses, 65 data lines are loaded into the cache.\
  We then visit the cached data lines with s1 again for several times, to construct cache hit but TLB miss (P2&P3).
- set s3 = 1 element and repeatedly load the data in a cache line so that every memory access is a cache hit (P1).

- The Maxwell and Kepler devices have a unique memory access pattern (P6) for page table context switching. \
  When a kernel is launched, only memory page entries of 512 MB are activated. \
  If the thread visits an inactivate page entry, the hardware needs a rather long time to switch between page tables.\
  This phenomena is also reported in [22] as page table “miss”.
- The Maxwell L1 data cache addressing does not go through the TLBs or page tables.\
  On the GTX980, there is no TLB miss pattern (i.e., P2 and P3) when the L1 data cache is hit.\
  Once the L1 cache is missed, the access latency increases from tens of cycles to hundreds or even thousands of cycles.
  **My comments: But if we look at GTX560Ti in P2, the latency is different with P1. So does this means that in Fermi, the memory request has to go through TLB first, and then access L1 DataCache? This might be the reason that the latency is longer. But this will degrade the performance....**
- The TLBs are off-chip. we infer that the physical memory locations of the L1 TLB and L2 data cache are close. \
  The physical memory locations of the L1 TLB and L2 TLB are also close, which means that the L1/L2 TLB and L2 data cache are shared off-chip by all SMs.
- The GTX780 generally has the shortest global memory latencies, almost half that of the Fermi, with an access pattern of P2-P5.\
  The page table context switching of the GTX980 is also much more expensive than that of the GTX780.
  
To summarize, the Maxwell device has *long global memory access latencies* for cold cache misses and page table context switching.\
Except for these rare access patterns, its access latency cycles are close to those of the Kepler device. \
because the GTX980 has higher fmem than the GTX780, it actually offers the shortest global memory access time (P2-P4).
