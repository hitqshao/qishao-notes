## 6. Managed Memory
Managed Memory does not promise performance.\
It only paves ways for software programmer. For example, deepcopy.

We could restore the performance by using cudaMemPrefetchAsync

**UM cannot do better than expertly written manual data movement, in most cases**

- Unified Memory: Page-faulting
- ATS: Nvidia with Power9. ATS service allows GPU to access CPU (Malloc) Memory\
  Only works in Power9, not for X86.
- HMM: Nvidia is working on HMM to allow similar with ATS.

## 7. Concurrency

### Pin Memory
- Statically allocated in Physical Memory.
- Stay out of paging system.

### Streams

- Sequential in Stream
- No order among Streams
