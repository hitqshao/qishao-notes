Managed Memory does not promise performance.\
It only paves ways for software programmer. For example, deepcopy.

**UM cannot do better than expertly written manual data movement, in most cases**

- Unified Memory: Page-faulting
- ATS: Nvidia with Power9. ATS service allows GPU to access CPU (Malloc) Memory\
  Only works in Power9, not for X86.
- HMM: Nvidia is working on HMM to allow similar with ATS.
