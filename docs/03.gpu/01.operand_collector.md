**Warped-Compression: Enabling Power Efficient GPUs through Register Compression**

each register bank entry can store up to four 32-bit register values. All thread registers in a warp are statically allocated on consecutive banks with the same entry
index. Therefore, to read one operand of a warp instruction,a buffering unit called operand collector needs to access up to eight register banks with the same index within each bank.
While operands from different banks may be concurrently read, operands that access the same bank lead to bank conflicts.

**CORF: Coalescing Operand Register File for GPUs**

Figure 1 shows our baseline register file organization for the Fermi generation of Nvidia GPUs. It has a register file size of 128 KB per SM split across four banks. A bank is made up of 8 sub-banks that are 128 bits wide each. All 32 registers belonging to the 32 threads in the same warp are statically allocated to consecutive sub-banks (in a single bank) with the same entry index. Thus, a full register for all the threads within a warp can be striped using one entry of one bank, allowing it to be operated on in a single cycle. Each bank can store up to 256 warp-registers.

Summary
They all assume that 128bit entry in each bank will supply 4 register to 4 thread in 32 thread per swap.

Warped-Compression assumes that 8 bank will supply 32 registers for a warp.
CORF assumes that 8 subbank in each bank will supply 32 registers for a warp.
