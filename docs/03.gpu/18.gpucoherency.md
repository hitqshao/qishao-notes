1. [213] Cache Coherence for GPU Architectures

Library Cache Coherence (LCC), that implements sequential consistency on CMPs by stalling writes to cache blocks until they have been self-invalidated by all sharers.

Library Cache Coherence (LCC) [34, 54] is a time-based hardware coherence proposal that stores timestamps in a directory structure and delays stores to unexpired blocks to enforce sequential consistency on CMPs. The TC-Strong implementation
of the TC framework is similar to LCC as both enforce write atomicity by stalling writes at the shared last level cache.

We propose TC-Weak and a novel time-based memory fence mechanism to eliminate all write-stalling, improve performance, and reduce interconnect traffic compared to TC-Strong.
