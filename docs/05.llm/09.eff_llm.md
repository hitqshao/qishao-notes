Computation complexity of attention is O(T 2D), whereas that of the FFN is O(TD2), where T represents the sequence length and D the hidden state dimension of the model.\
The FFN layer is the most computationally intensive component.


## 1. Resource-Efficient Architectures
### 1.1 Efficient Attention

- **Sparse Attention**: Reduces complexity (e.g., Longformer, BigBird).\
Motivated by graph sparsification, sparse attention aims to build a sparse attention matrix.\
This approach aims to retain the empirical advantages of a fully quadratic self-attention scheme while employing a reduced number of inner products.

- **Approximate Attention**: Low-rank approximations (e.g., Linformer, Reformer).
Approximate attention mainly includes low-rank approximations of the self-attention matrix and innovative reformulations of the self-attention.

- **Attention-Free Approaches**: Alternatives like Hyena, Mamba.\
Despite the dominance of attention-based transformer architectures in large FMs, several works have put forth innovative architectures that hold the potential to replace the traditional transformer model.

### 1.2 Dynamic Neural Network

- **Mixture of Experts (MoE)**: (e.g., Switch Transformer, GLaM, MoEfication, FFF).

- **Early Exiting**: Premature termination based on confidence (e.g., FREE, SkipDecode,DeeBERT, PABEE).
early-exiting optimization is a strategy that allows a model to terminate its computational process prematurely when it attains high confidence in the prediction or encounters resource constraints.
