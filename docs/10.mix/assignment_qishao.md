# Software Engineering Assignment - Qi Shao

## Introduction
My research focuses on computer microarchitecture and memory subsystem. We try to improve the performance of CPU/GPU/Memory to achieve better IPC (Instruction per Cycle) as to CPU and higher throughput for GPU. Since it is unmanageable to program from silicon level, like Verilog or VHDL language
