### Leakge Current Moore's Law Meets Static Power

Off-state leakage is static power, current that leaks through transistors even when they are turned off.

- It is one of two principal sources of power dissipation in today’s microprocessors.
- The other is dynamic power, which arises from the repeated capacitance charge and discharge on the output of the hundreds of millions of gates in today’s chips.
  - subthreshold leakage, a weak inversion current across the device; and
  - gate leakage, a tunneling current through the gate oxide insulation.
 
Dynamic power is proportional to the square of supply voltage, so reducing the voltage significantly reduces power consumption. 
 
Unfortunately, smaller geometries exacerbate leakage, so static power begins to dominate the power consumption equation in microprocessor design.

### Power Basics
#### Operating Frequency and volatage

we see that f = 0 corresponds to Vnorm = Vth / Vmax, which for today’s technology is approximately 0.3.

Reducing the operating frequency by a particular percentage from fmax will reduce the operating voltage by a smaller percentage.

### Overall Power Consumption

- The first term is the dynamic power lost from charging and discharging the processor’s capacitive loads: A is the fraction of gates actively switching and C is the total capacitance load of all gates. 
- The second term models the static power lost due to leakage current, Ileak.

In fact, halving the voltage will reduce the power consumption by a factor of four. But Equation 2 shows that halving the voltage will reduce the processor’s maximum operating frequency by more than half.

To compensate for this performance loss, we can use either parallel or pipelined implementations.

If the implementation runs the original serial computation as two parallel subtasks or as two pipelined subtasks, the dynamic power consumption can decrease by more than a factor of two compared to the serial case.



### Leakage current

As noted, leakage current, the source of static power consumption, is a combination of subthreshold and gate-oxide leakage: Ileak = Isub + Iox.

#### Subthreshold power leakage

How to reduce Isub
- First, we could turn off the supply voltage—that is, set V to zero so that the factor in parentheses also becomes zero.
- Second, we could increase the threshold voltage, which—because it appears as a negative exponent—can have a dramatic effect in even small increments. On the other hand, we know from Equation 1 that increasing Vth will **reduce speed**.

The problem with the first approach is loss of state;

The problem with the second approach is the loss of performance.

Gate width W is the other contributor to subthreshold leakage in a particular transistor. Designers often use the combined widths of all the processor’s transistors as a convenient measure of total subthreshold leakage.

#### Gate-oxide power leakage

K2 and α are experimentally derived. The term of interest is oxide thickness, Tox.

Tox will reduce gate leakage. Unfortunately, it also degrades the transistor’s effectiveness because Tox must decrease proportionally with process scaling to avoid short channel effects.

#### Low-power architectural options

Because subthreshold and oxide leakage both depend on total gate width or, approximately, gate count.

Pipelined implementations can run at a lower voltage, which can reduce power consumption for both dynamic and static power compared to the serial case.

Parallel implementations can also run at a lower voltage, but only by roughly doubling the amount of hardware.

## REDUCING STATIC POWER CONSUMPTION

### Retention flip-flops

For shorter inactive periods, researchers have developed “balloon” logic, also called retention flip-flops. The idea is to use highVth latches to duplicate those latches that must preserve state.

Using doping techniques or applying a bias voltage to the substrate can increase threshold voltage by 100 mV. This in turn reduces leakage by a factor of about 10, but it increases switching time by about 15 percent.

Thus, lowleakage retention flops are only useful in saving state energy efficiently—their use on the processor’s critical path would slow it down.

### Controlling memory leakage

In fact, leakage is projected to account for 70 percent of the cache power budget in 70-nm technology.

Both bitline and cell leakage result from subthreshold conduction—current flowing from the source to drain even when gate-source voltage is below the threshold voltage.

#### Circuit techniques.
- State-destructive
- State-preserving techniques vary. Drowsy caches multiplex supply voltages according to the state of each cache line or block. Waking up the drowsy cache lines is treated as a pseudo cache miss and incurs one additional cycle overhead.
  
   Moreover, while state-preserving techniques can only reduce leakage by about a factor of 10, compared to more than a factor of 1,000 for destructive techniques, the net difference in power consumed by the two techniques is less than 10 percent.

#### Control techniques.

- application-sensitive controls, based on runtime performance feedback,9,13 and 
- application-insensitive controls, which periodically turn off cache lines.

#### Compiler techniques
- Using compiler directives might make it possible to keep some loops within bank boundaries.
- The compiler can also provide application-sensitive leakage control.

## TECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND CHALLENGES

One approach to reducing subthreshold leakage is to actively refrigerate the chip. 

While this option seems promising for controlling the subthreshold leakage point, it does not address gateoxide leakage.

Designers assign a low threshold voltage to a few performance-critical transistors and a high threshold voltage to the majority of less timing-critical transistors.

This approach incurs a high subthreshold leakage current for the performance-critical transistors, but it can significantly reduce the overall leakage.

future technologies are likely to offer three threshold voltages—low, high, and extra high—or even more.

This opens the way to new leakage optimizations within different portions of a cache or at different levels of its hierarchy.

the address-decoder and bus-driver circuits in a cache consume a significant portion of total access time, so a designer could construct them from high-Vth transistors, while constructing the more numerous bit cells from extra-high-Vth devices and reserving low-Vth devices for speed-critical parts of the processor core.
