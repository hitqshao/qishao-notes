### Leakge Current Moore's Law Meets Static Power

Off-state leakage is static power, current that leaks through transistors even when they are turned off.

- It is one of two principal sources of power dissipation in today’s microprocessors.
- The other is dynamic power, which arises from the repeated capacitance charge and discharge on the output of the hundreds of millions of gates in today’s chips.
  - subthreshold leakage, a weak inversion current across the device; and
  - gate leakage, a tunneling current through the gate oxide insulation.
 
Dynamic power is proportional to the square of supply voltage, so reducing the voltage significantly reduces power consumption. 
 
Unfortunately, smaller geometries exacerbate leakage, so static power begins to dominate the power consumption equation in microprocessor design.

we see that f = 0 corresponds to Vnorm = Vth / Vmax, which for today’s technology is approximately 0.3.

Reducing the operating frequency by a particular percentage from fmax will reduce the operating voltage by a smaller percentage.

#### Overall Power Consumption

- The first term is the dynamic power lost from charging and discharging the processor’s capacitive loads: A is the fraction of gates actively switching and C is the total capacitance load of all gates. 
- The second term models the static power lost due
to leakage current, Ileak.
