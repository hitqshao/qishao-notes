### Leakge Current Moore's Law Meets Static Power

Off-state leakage is static power, current that leaks through transistors even when they are turned off.

- It is one of two principal sources of power dissipation in today’s microprocessors.
- The other is dynamic power, which arises from the repeated capacitance charge and discharge on the output of the hundreds of millions of gates in today’s chips.
  - subthreshold leakage, a weak inversion current across the device; and
  - gate leakage, a tunneling current through the gate oxide insulation.
 
Dynamic power is proportional to the square of supply voltage, so reducing the voltage significantly reduces power consumption. 
 
Unfortunately, smaller geometries exacerbate leakage, so static power begins to dominate the power consumption equation in microprocessor design.

we see that f = 0 corresponds to Vnorm = Vth / Vmax, which for today’s technology is approximately 0.3.

Reducing the operating frequency by a particular percentage from fmax will reduce the operating voltage by a smaller percentage.

#### Overall Power Consumption

- The first term is the dynamic power lost from charging and discharging the processor’s capacitive loads: A is the fraction of gates actively switching and C is the total capacitance load of all gates. 
- The second term models the static power lost due to leakage current, Ileak.

In fact, halving the voltage will reduce the power consumption by a factor of four. But Equation 2 shows that halving the voltage will reduce the processor’s maximum operating frequency by more than half.

To compensate for this performance loss, we can use either parallel or pipelined implementations.

#### Leakage current

As noted, leakage current, the source of static power consumption, is a combination of subthreshold and gate-oxide leakage: Ileak = Isub + Iox.

##### Subthreshold power leakage

How to reduce Isub
- First, we could turn off the supply voltage—that is, set V to zero so that the factor in parentheses also becomes zero.
- Second, we could increase the threshold voltage, which—because it appears as a negative exponent—can have a dramatic effect in even small increments. On the other hand, we know from Equation 1 that increasing Vth will **reduce speed**.

The problem with the first approach is loss of state;

The problem with the second approach is the loss of performance.


Gate width W is the other contributor to subthreshold leakage in a particular transistor. Designers often use the combined widths of all the processor’s transistors as a convenient measure of total subthreshold leakage.
