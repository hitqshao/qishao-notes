## CUDA Merge

Difficulty: :+1: :+1: :+1: :+1: :+1: 

The merge algorithm is much more complex than matrix multiplication and sorting, maybe even more complex than prefix-sum reduction.

Lets illustrate how this works.

The problem:

given ordered array A and ordered array B, merge the array.

This algorthm is output-centric.

Each thread-block is responsible for merging a tile of C.

Each thread is responsible for merging several consective elements of C.

Since we want to use parallel algorthm to solve this problem, we want to divide and solve the C.

**If given any position C, we could find its startpoint of A and startpoint of B, when we could just assign each thread with position**, by some magic algorithm like :pouting_cat::
- thread0, C Pos 0, finds where to start in A and B by thread0 itself
- thread1, C Pos 8, finds where to start in A and B by thread1 itself
- thread2, C Pos 12, finds where to start in A and B by thread2 itself
- thread3, C Pos 16, finds where to start in A and B by thread3 itself

Then we could solve the question.

**Another idea deserved to be mention is that since A and B are consective, we could load them into share memory, so threads could use memory coalescing to access them.**

Those above two idea are the core idea of merge.

Then, the only left question is how to implement the algorithm. :pouting_cat:

It follows the basic idea that:

1) if we have two ordered array
a[i-1] a[i]

b[j-1] b[j]

the start point we want to find for A and B must follows:

a[i-1] <= b[j]

b[j-1] < a[i]

Thus if we know the start point of A and B, we could just use binary search to gradually get the start of A and B

2)
Another rule is if we want to calculate for C Pos X, elements before C contains number of I elements in A and number of j elements in B.

This helps to understand.

If each thread is assigned by 4 elements and for thread 2, it want to know where to start from A and B.

The expected position is 5th in A and 3th in B.

It follows the above two rules.
