## bank conflict in shared memory

[nvidia-forum](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/how-to-understand-the-bank-conflict-of-shared-mem/260900)

Largest transaction size is 128 bytes(32 thread, 4 byte for each thread).

If each thread access 16 bytes, Thread0 -Thread7 will issue one transaction.\
Thread 8 - Thread15 will issue another transaction.

In this case, even thread 0 and thread 8 shares the same bank.\
As long as they are not in the same transaction, there would be no bank conflict.

Usually we will use tile[TILE_SIZE+1] to avoid bank conflict.

### about matrix multiplication

If matrix M and N are not transposed, I suppose both of them will not meet issue of bank conflict.

If Threads(0,0) and Threads(0,1) are to calculate P(0,0) and P(0,1),\
they will read the same element from M, since they are in the same warp.\
They will read different column from N, in thread coalescing way.

## open-source implementation to achieve 95% cuBLAS performance
[95% cuBLAS](https://accu.org/journals/overload/32/181/schuetze/)

[github](https://github.com/qishao-chalmers/CudaTensorCoreHGEMM)

Main Idea:
- double buffer
- async loading

## Vectorized Memory Access

[Vectorized Memory Access- LeiMao](https://leimao.github.io/blog/CUDA-Vectorized-Memory-Access/)
[CUDA Pro Tip](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-pro-tip-increase-performance-with-vectorized-memory-access/)

This blog conduct experiments on 4byte/8byte/16byte per thread accessing global memory.

16-byte per thread achieves effective memory bandwidth.

This might explain why float4 works.

- higher memory bandwidth usage
- less instruction
