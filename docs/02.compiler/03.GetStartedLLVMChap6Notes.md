**White box** Essential
**Gray Block** For generated code efficiency
1. Instructon Selection<br>
  * Convert IR to target-specific SelectionDAG(Directed Acyclic Graph)
    - Block->DAG
    - Instruction->Node
    - Edge contains dataflow dependence and control dependence and glue.
  * LLVM use DAG to employ tree-based pattern-matching instruction selection.
  * IN the end of this phase, IR node are converted to target-machine(machine instructions) nodes.
2. Pre-register Allocation(RA) scheduling,the first instruction scheduling.<br>
  * This is to explore instruction-level parallelism
  * The instructions are converted to MachineInstr three-address representation.
3. Reguster Allocation<br>
4. Post-register Allocation(RA) Instruction Scheduling, the second instruction scheduling
  * Now we have real register information, we can combine information of extra hazards and delays of real register to opmitize code.
5. Code Emission
  * Convert MachineInstr to MCInst
  * Emit Assembly Code
  * Emit Binary blobs to object code format
